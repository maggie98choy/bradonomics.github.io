If you were hoping for some original research, sadly I have none. What follows has already been written about elsewhere and by people far smarter them me. What I hope to bring to the conversation is a simplified version of their work and my story in discovering it. But more importantly, I hope to introduce you to some thoughts on adult language learning that fall outside the standard techniques of translation and grammar study.

I'm the only guy on the internet who will tell you that practice is making you worse.
