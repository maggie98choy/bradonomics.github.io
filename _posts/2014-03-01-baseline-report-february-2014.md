As I've explained before, most of the time I've lived in Thailand I've been a university student so my living expenses have included tuition---this month the bill was due.

Before I get into the explanations, let's look at the numbers. Remember this is for two people; my girlfriend's expenses are also included.

Conversion of the Baht as I'm writing this is 32.51 for one US Dollar, 44.94 for one Euro and 54.48 for one British Pound. My total expenses for the month are as follows:

|Currency      |Total   |
|--------------|--------|
|Thai Baht     |68,703  |
|US Dollar     |2,113   |
|Euro          |1,529   |
|British Pound |1,261   |

## Tuition and VISA's

Thailand VISA's are an oft discussed issue among expats. All of us are looking for a way to stay here and looking for the cheapest, most convenient way to do so. While there are a number of options, I'm going to explain only two of them. The ED VISA and the Student VISA. For most people an ED VISA means a Thai language school and while looking for numbers to compare to my own, I found an article by [Jeff Blum on Lengthy Travel](http://www.lengthytravel.com/studying-thai-in-chiang-mai-advice-from-a-long-term-chiang-mai-resident/) discussing his situation.

A Thailand VISA Comparison:

|Day |Activity           | ED VISA | Student VISA | Difference |
|----|-------------------|---------|--------------|------------|
|0   |Trip to Vientiane* |5,450    |2,000         |3,450       |
|90  |Immigration        |1,900    |1,900         |0           |
|180 |Immigration        |1,900    |0             |1,900       |
|    |Totals             |         |              |            |
|----|-------------------|---------|--------------|------------|
|    |Thai Baht          |9,250    |3,900         |-5,350      |
|    |US Dollars         |285      |120           |-165        |


*Jeff breaks down the cost of a Laos VISA run on his site. While I think the costs will be more than this for the average person, I'll leave the numbers as he's listed them. Another thing to note is most university students would get their VISA from their home country before coming and wouldn't need to leave Thailand, hence the cheaper initial cost.

Check out Jeff's article for more on the [difference between one year on a tourist VISA versus one year on an ED VISA](http://www.lengthytravel.com/studying-thai-in-chiang-mai-advice-from-a-long-term-chiang-mai-resident/). In that article he also discusses language school options in Chiang Mai and while [I'm not a big fan of the methods at those schools](http://bradonomics.com/stupid-learn-second-language/), it is a great resource for weighing your options. But now let's talk about ED vs Student VISA's.

ED VISA's are the standard three-month VISA's offered by language schools. If you are already in Thailand, on a tourist VISA, you'll need to visit a Thai consulate outside Thailand to switch to the ED VISA. But once you're in Thailand on your ED VISA you can renew it, without leaving, so long as you continue paying the tuition at your language school.

Becoming a university student is slightly different. Most people enroll from their home country and apply for their VISA before coming. If you go this route you'll get the same ED VISA as discussed above. Once your tuition has been paid for the first semester you will be given paperwork to switch to a Student VISA. This is a one-year VISA, although the first year it only extends you by nine months since the ED VISA gave you three already.

I hope the graph above is making sense by this point. But one thing to note about that graph is that Jeff and I are only talking about VISA fees. In both of these cases you'll need to pay tuition. Tuition at Payap University, a private school in Chiang Mai, is between 55,000 and 80,000 per semester depending on your major. Payap has one fee per semester no matter how many classes you enroll. A cheaper option is Ramkhamhaeng University, a public school in Bangkok, which charges per credit hour and will run about 30,000-40,000 per semester.

## A New Job, a New Motorbike

The other big expense this month was the purchase of a motorbike. Since I've got a new job, I'll need some way to get there. I was weighing the pros and cons of a motorbike and bicycle but ultimately decided something motorized would be more convenient. I suspect my overall transportation expenses will go up and if I didn't have a job I wouldn't have bought one. I think Chiang Mai is easy enough to get around without your own bike.
