With so many people talking about how much it cost to live in Chiang Mai, I thought I'd add some additional analysis this month.

But first, the numbers:

|Currency      |Total |
|--------------|------|
|Thai Baht     |18,650|
|US Dollars    |580   |
|Euros         |432   |
|British Pounds|344   |

The obligatory graph:

And chart:

The numbers above are, as with [every other report I've published](http://bradonomics.com/baseline-report/), for two people. But I noticed most of the talk around expenses in Southeast Asia are for single travelers. It's too difficult, day-by-day, to account for my expenses versus my girlfriend's expenses, but I've factored out her expenses in the graph below.

The column on the right has my best guess as to what percent of the expense is mine. Things like rent wouldn't change if I were living along, but things like laundry and food would be reduced.

I think it's important when talking about how much it costs to live in a place like Chiang Mai that you don't use blanket statements like "you can live a good life there on $1,000/month." It's better if you talk about what's possible and what's probable. It's possible that you can live on $500-$600 per month—VISA runs included. I've done it for over 5 years. It's more likely that you'll spend more. [Kevin and Richard spend about $2,000](http://www.nichesitenomads.com/burn-rate-report-month-5-may-2014/).

Dig around, find some reports and make your own average. You might find some people living below the standard you want to live or living lavishly. Just factor the people who are living most like you want to live ...and that's how much it's likely to cost _you_ to live there.
