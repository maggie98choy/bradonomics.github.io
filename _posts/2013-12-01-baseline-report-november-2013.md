Taking a look at October and November side-by-side, you can see the rent has dropped since I didn't have to pay the deposit this month. Otherwise things are about equal.

Nothing especially exciting this month so I've got nothing to say that the numbers don't already tell.

### My First Condo in Chiang Mai

The first six months I lived in Thailand I was renting a condo for 10,000 baht. It was owned by an English lady and she'd posted the details on the internet. It was near my university and available so I took it. Below are some photos:

### Moving to Cheaper Digs

After my six-month lease was up I moved to a nearby apartment building---one not listed on the internet and therefore much cheaper. It wasn't as nice but it did have air conditioning and a hot shower. And it was 2,300 per month (about $70 USD). Below are some photos:

The place where I live now is somewhere in between these two---both in price and comfort.

I hope this gives you some better idea of what life is like (or _can_ be like) in Chiang Mai.
