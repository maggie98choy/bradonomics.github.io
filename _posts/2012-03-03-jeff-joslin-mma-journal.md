In 2011 I started a podcast called FightMap. The podcast is now defunct but I enjoyed this talk with Jeff Joslin so much I wanted it available somewhere on the web. So here it is, as it ran on FightMap, on Bradonomics:

Some years ago I was on YouTube when I found a video of Jeff Joslin showing his 700-page Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu journal. As soon as the video was over I wanted to talk with Jeff. I had so many questions about training when you didn't live near a big team, or any Jiu-Jitsu team at all.
