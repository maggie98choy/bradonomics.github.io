In case you're new to the Baseline Report, these are my expenses living in Chiang Mai Thailand. And this is for two people; my girlfriend's expenses are also included.

Conversion of the Baht as I'm writing this is 32.38 for one US Dollar, 44.6 for one Euro and 53.95 for one British Pound. My total expenses for the month are as follows:

|Currency     |Total |
|-------------|------|
|Thai Baht    |16,693|
|US Dollar    |515   |
|Euro         |374   |
|BritishÂ Pound|309   |

Things are back to normal levels this month after the large spend last month on tuition and a new motorbike.
