After Pat Flynn started publishing [monthly income reports](http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/tag/monthly-income-report/), a lot of entrepreneurs, especially those in the affiliate space, jumped on the bandwagon. When these reports first started I thought they were great but quickly started to see some limitations. As long as you intend to do something similar to the guy publishing the report, they can be helpful. But what if your business is completely different?

In 2009 I moved to Thailand with the goal of starting a business. My idea was to leave the US where my savings (and GI Bill) would go further---but Thailand was arbitrary. Shortly after I moved Dan Andrews started publishing a podcast and talking about creative baselining and whether it was better to bootstrap a business from the Philippines or Bali or Thailand. Here are some of the articles:

*   [Thailand vs. Bali vs. the Philippines. What's the Best Spot for an Internet Entrepreneur?](http://www.tropicalmba.com/thailand-vs-bali-vs-philippines/)
*   [One of the Cheapest Ways to Start Your Online Business](http://www.tropicalmba.com/for-the-bold-one-of-the-cheapest-ways-to-start-your-online-business/)
*   [Use Mobility to Win Back Your Time + The Real Cost of Living in Bali](http://www.tropicalmba.com/cost-of-living-in-bali/)

Most of the time I've lived in Thailand I've been a university student so my living expenses have included tuition. One benefit of being a student is getting a year-long VISA so I don't have to do border runs. Over these four years I've averaged around $1,000 USD in expenses per month. It didn't matter if I was paying tuition or, in the year I took off, doing VISA runs every three months---my expenses were the same. But having not kept a budget I can't be certain of my expenses and that's why I decided to start the Baseline Report.

It seems to me that a report of living expenses would be more useful to bootstrapping entrepreneurs than an income report. As the months go by I'll explain more about my living situation so you can have a better idea of what your expenses might be if you choose to launch your business from Chiang Mai.

## Things to Note About this Report

![A categorized list of my expenses for Chiang Mai Thailand.](http://bradonomics.com/baseline-report-october-2013/Chiang-Mai-Spending-Category-List-Oct-2013.jpg "Categorized List of Expenses")After a couple years in Bangkok I decided to move back to Chiang Mai so October will have a little "start-up weirdness" that the following months won't. Things like higher rent payment---two months instead of one---and no utility expenses.

Also, this report is the expenses for two people. I found it difficult to list my expenses separately from my girlfriends expenses in most cases.

You can see the categorized breakdown in the image on the right. As you can probably guess things like toiletries get lumped in with "household goods" and food covers everything in the category no matter where it was eaten.

Conversion of the Baht as I'm writing this is 31.06 for one US Dollar, 42.12 for one Euro and 49.94 for one British Pound. My total expenses for the month are as follows:

|Currency-----|Total-|
|-------------|------|
|Thai Baht----|27,381|
|US Dollar----|881---|
|Euro---------|644---|
|BritishÂ Pound|548---|

If you're a bit more visual or interested in these expenses as a percentage, here's a graph to help:
