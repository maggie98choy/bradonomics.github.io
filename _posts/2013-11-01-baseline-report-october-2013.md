<img class="alignleft" src="{{ site.url }}/images/baseline-report/Chiang-Mai-Spending-Category-List-Oct-2013.jpg" alt="Chiang Mai Spending Category List Oct 2013">After a couple years in Bangkok I decided to move back to Chiang Mai so October will have a little "start-up weirdness" that the following months won't. Things like higher rent payment---two months instead of one---and no utility expenses.

Also, this report is the expenses for two people. I found it difficult to list my expenses separately from my girlfriends expenses in most cases.

You can see the categorized breakdown in the image on the right. As you can probably guess things like toiletries get lumped in with "household goods" and food covers everything in the category no matter where it was eaten.

Conversion of the Baht as I'm writing this is 31.06 for one US Dollar, 42.12 for one Euro and 49.94 for one British Pound. My total expenses for the month are as follows:

|Currency     |Total |
|-------------|------|
|Thai Baht    |27,381|
|US Dollar    |881   |
|Euro         |644   |
|BritishÂ Pound|548   |

If you're a bit more visual or interested in these expenses as a percentage, here's a graph to help:

Since this is my first time publishing this report I need your help in making it better. If you feel I've left out some information that would be useful, please email me brad@bradonomics.com.
