Last month I posted almost no information other than the numbers. A recap to understand what's going on behind these numbers is probably needed.

Most of the time I've lived in Thailand I've been a university student so my living expenses have included tuition. That means I get a student VISA and have no need to do border runs. Over the the last five years I've averaged around $1,000 USD in expenses per month. It didn't matter if I was paying tuition or, in the year I took off, doing VISA runs every three months---my expenses were the same.

The biggest note is that these expenses are for two people. It's often difficult to separate my expenses from my girlfriend's expenses since we live together.

Conversion of the Baht as I'm writing this is 33.03 for one US Dollar, 44.53 for one Euro and 54.27 for one British Pound. My total expenses for the month are as follows:

|Currency      |Total |
|--------------|------|
|Thai Baht     |17,020|
|US Dollar     |515   |
|Euro          |382   |
|British Pound |314   |

Information I wish I'd had more of when I first moved was how to find an apartment. Since I'll be moving soon to the other side of town, I've been looking at apartment buildings. And that's really the best way. Anything you can find online in English is going to be a bit expensive. Knowing what part of town you want to live in and walking to each building to inquire will generally get you a better price than using the internet.

Here is one place I found near Chiang Mai University. It was on a dead-end street so it should have less traffic noise. The photos of the rooms on their webpage look just how I found them (a rarity) so you can click here to see what the place looks like: [http://www.sa-nguanmalee.com/flash_gal/dynamic_gal.php?pc=over-view](http://www.sa-nguanmalee.com/flash_gal/dynamic_gal.php?pc=over-view)
