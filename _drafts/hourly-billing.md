Time Tracking and Why I Hate Working Per Hour



I just want to build cool, useful stuff. Keeping track of time adds overhead to my day; time I could have used thinking about the problems to be solved or doing anything else productive. Instead of that, I worry about time.




Hourly vs project billing is not a new topic in software. In case you aren't familiar with the arguments, here's the short version:

The Problem From the Clients' View

Per project prices are usually over estimated, while hourly billed projects have the potential to reach budget without functioning software.

The Problem From the Developers' View

Per project prices are over estimated to account for last minute changes not included in the scope of work, while hourly billed projects require the developer to keep track of time.

This last point might seem obvious and a non-issue to non-developers, but how should time be tracked? That might seem a very obvious answer, but let's explore.

How Should I Keep Track of Time?

Keeping time while I'm writing code in an editor seems logical, but what about when I need to look up documentation? Should that be billed to the client or is that on me? What about that time I spent in the shower thinking about the project, should that be clocked? Or when I was walking in the park and an idea popped into my head? Or what about that time I woke up in the middle of the night and had an idea? I know almost nothing about dreams so I'm not sure how long that code-dream was happening before the solution came to me; should that time count?









Perhaps this is a solved issue and I just haven't run into the solution yet? If you've got thoughts, please email me I'd love to hear.
