Introduced to Unix in 1999

Growing up in rural Alabama has its advantages. Access to computers is not one of them.

In 2000 when I attended a month long course at the [Marine Corps Communication Electronics School](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Corps_Communication_Electronics_School). This was only one year after having floundered my way through their basic "small computer systems" course and I was sent there since some of the systems I was expected to support were built on HP-UX.

There was something different about UNIX. I had learned a lot in my year since graduating the basic course, but there were many things I still couldn't do with the systems I was assigned to maintain.

First tried Linux (RedHat) on my home system in 2002

After separating from the military my computer was getting old and I didn't have much money to buy a new one. I knew Linux was easier on system resources than Windows so I decided to give it a try. I'd heard you could run it as a desktop environment and the graphical elements were getting better everyday. But, of course, nothing worked.

I got RedHat installed, which was easier than I thought, but

Nothing worked

Tried every 2-4 years to see where Linux had gone

In 2013 started dual booting Ubuntu

Still using Windows 95%

Read tk about open source software. Decided to give Linux more play time.

Increased use of linux more and more till everything I needed to do worked as it did on Windows.

By mid-2015 I was 100% Linux.
