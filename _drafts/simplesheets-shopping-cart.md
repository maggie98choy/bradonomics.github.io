Was looking for a shopping cart that used Google Docs

Found a few older projects with little documentation and overly difficult implementation.

Decided to put together my own solution.

Started with simpleCart(js). Added Sheetrock.js to pull data from the Google Spreadsheet. Used Handlebars.js to easily add the cell data to HTML. And used a modified Skeleton for CSS.


The main changes of Skeleton CSS are the Grid and tk.

<div class="wrap"><script src="https://gist.github.com/bradonomics/519d5e47e558ccecba93.js"></script></div>
