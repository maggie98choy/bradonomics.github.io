There is so much good stuff around. It's hard to narrow things down, but here are a few things I think worthy of mention.

## Books

I add most books---the good, bad, and ugly---to [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/bradonomics). These are some of my favorites.

<ul>
  <li style="list-style: none;"><strong><a href=""><em>The Gracie Way</em></a> by Kid Peligro</strong></li>
    <p></p>
  <li style="list-style: none;"><strong><a href=""><em>How to Get Rich</em></a> by Felix Dennis</strong></li>
    <p></p>
  <li style="list-style: none;"><strong><a href=""><em>The Millionaire Fastlane</em></a> by M.J. DeMarco</strong></li>
    <p></p>
  <li style="list-style: none;"><strong><a href=""><em>The Art of Non-Conformity</em></a> by Chris Guillebeau</strong></li>
    <p></p>
  <li style="list-style: none;"><strong><a href=""><em>The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing</em></a> by Al Ries and Jack Trout</strong></li>
    <p></p>
  <li style="list-style: none;"><strong><a href=""><em>Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind</em></a> by Al Ries and Jack Trout</strong></li>
    <p></p>
  <li style="list-style: none;"><strong><a href=""><em>Your Money or Your Life</em></a> by Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin</strong></li>
    <p></p>
  <li style="list-style: none;"><strong><a href=""><em>On Writing Well</em></a> by William Zinsser</strong></li>
    <p>If you've been inspired to write, there is no better guide than <em>On Writing Well</em>. Strunk and White's <a href=""><em>The Elements of Style</em></a> is a great reference book—something to check when you're not sure of a grammar or style rule—but Zinsser's book sets the stage for good, clear writing—and good, clear thinking.</p>
