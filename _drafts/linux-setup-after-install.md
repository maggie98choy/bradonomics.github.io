What follows is mostly for me. Every couple of years when I buy a new computer and have to reload my operating system, I want an easy way to remember what to install and how I had it configured. There's little explanation as to why I use the software below, it's just what I like.
<h2>Desktop Programs to Install</h2>
<h3>Chrome</h3>
<h3>Skype</h3>
<h3>Dropbox</h3>
<h3>Deluge</h3>
<h3>Redshift</h3>
<h3>RescueTime</h3>
<h3>Calibre</h3>
<h3>VLC</h3>
<h3>PulseAudio Volume Control</h3>

<h3>Kali Theme</h3>

<h2>Development Tools</h2>
<h3>Brackets</h3>
<h3>Apache</h3>
<h3>PHP</h3>
<h3>MySQL</h3>
<h3>phpMyAdmin</h3>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
Create a Keyboard Custom Launcher for System Monitor
Command: gnome-system-monitor
Shortcut: Ctrl-Shift-Escape (Just like Windows Task Manager)
