What follows is mostly for me. Every couple of years when I buy a new computer and have to reload my operating system, I want an easy way to remember what to install and how I had it configured. There's little explanation as to why I use the software below, it's just what I like.

## Desktop Programs to Install

### Chrome

### Skype

### Dropbox

### Deluge

### Redshift

### RescueTime

### Calibre

### VLC

### PulseAudio Volume Control

### Kali Theme

## Development Tools

### Atom

Packages:
 - git-plus
 - autoprefixer
 - atom-beautify

### Brackets

 Extensions:
  - Brackets Git
  - Beautify
  - Brackets Wordpress Hint
  - Extract for Brackets
  - JS CSS Minifier
  - Not So Annoying Whitespace Fixer
  - Todo

### Apache

### PHP

### MySQL

### phpMyAdmin

### Node & NPM

## Other OS Configurations

Create a Keyboard Custom Launcher for System Monitor
