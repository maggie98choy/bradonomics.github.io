There's a lot of [survivorship bias](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias) in the Digital Nomad, Location Independent Entrepreneurship space. Most of the advice is of the "don't wait, just buy your ticket and go, you'll figure it out when you get there" variety. But maybe that's _not_ what will happen. What follows is my journey from ~2002 till 2015.

I started my career as a computer system administrator. It was fun for about two years. Then I saw some early UFC tapes and all I could think about was becoming a professional fighter. I started training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Muay Thai and Boxing. Every evening after work I would go home and watch Fighters Club TV or some old UFC or Pride fights before going to the gym. Then in 2005 I finally arranged an amateur fight. It is a moment I'll never forget, but it didn't go exactly to plan. I thought I'd prepared such that it would be impossible to get tired. When the first round ended, I was so tired it seemed like my senses were shutting down. My cornermen jumped in the ring and I have no idea what they were saying. All I remember is one of them handing me a water bottle which I looked at, then handed back. Thankfully I was able to finish the fight early in the second round. I have no idea how winded my opponent was, but I doubt I could have continued much longer.

In the weeks following the fight I knew I wasn't to be a professional fighter. I could at the guys who were a few years ahead of me and see very different physical attributes and abilities. It occurred to me that these guys had won the genetic lottery and I had not. I didn't see any way to get around this. They were able to train twice as hard as I was. When I tried increasing the volume of my training I would get sick or injured.

Even though I didn't want to be a pro fighter, I still wanted to do something in the fight industry.

## MMA Podcast

I had been a fan of podcasting and saw the success people like Lloyd Irvin had selling information products and thought I'd could marry the two. I've heard stories about people learning Jiu-Jitsu quickly, people like BJ Penn getting a blackbelt in four years for example, but it took me a really long time to get even marginal results. I thought there must be a better and faster way to learn. I decided to call my podcast White Belt Radio. I bought the domain and setup all the social media profiles to protect the name. Then the guys at MMA Diehards decided to start a podcast with the same name. Worried about a lawsuit for trademark infringement and subconsciously looking for any excuse to procrastinate I decided to change the name. I had the idea for the site in 2008, but with all this, I wouldn't publish anything till 2011.

## Niche Sites

I had been following the AdSense Flippers and watched as they set up a boat-load of small websites monetized with Google AdSense. It seemed easy enough so I did some keyword research and thought I could rank for Kirby Vacuums and Big 10 Tires. I bought some domains and setup the sites. I wasn't more than a month in before I started feeling really bad for writing web spam. What's that? You didn't know niche sites were spam? Well, it might not be as bad as YouTube comments, but no one is really happy when they land on a niche site. I mean really ... what could I say about Kirby Vacuums that Kirby hasn't already published? And Big 10 Tires? They were bought by Pep Boys. Believe me Pep Boys has said everything they care to say about what's going to happen with Big 10 after the acquisition. I might be able to rank for this, but who cares? I wasn't happy writing articles to game the system, so I shut them down.

## Podcasting, Take Two

White Belt Radio was still in the back of my mind. I knew the fight game and knew I could produce something in that space that wouldn't make me feel like I was contributing to the shittyness of the internet. I decided to actually try a podcast. I bought the domain FightMap.com and scheduled some interviews with people in the space I thought would make for interesting listening. After about 4 or 5 episodes I decided to stop. A few years before I'd torn the PCL in my left knee and hadn't been playing Jiu-Jitsu. I also felt that not being in Los Angeles or Las Vegas was a real disadvantage. It was all in my head of course, but it was enough for my lizard brain to freak-out and for me to shutdown the site.

(One of the episodes I enjoyed so much I decided to keep it live. If you're interested you can [listen here]({{ site.url }}/jeff-joslin-mma-journal/).)

## English Language School

In 2011 I had moved to Bangkok to attend the AUA language school after [failing Thai classes at university]({{ site.url }}/second-language/). I was already sold on the ALG system, but hadn't considered teaching. I thought I'd try my hand at a bricks and mortar business. If this internet stuff wasn't going to workout, maybe this was my path to entrepreneurship.

I met another American interested in the ALG system so we got a seed group of students and started tutoring at a university library. The students seemed to like it so we started looking for office space to start a proper school. We talked with a lawyer to discuss business structure and what might work for us, but were discouraged to find our options to operate in Thailand were very restricted. We heard from a friend about establishing as a "school" under the Ministry of Education instead of a business under the Ministry of Labor. The Ministry of Education told us, to start the process we'd need to present our lease agreement, our curriculum and paper receipts from students---meaning the MoE was asking us to operate illegally. I was OK with the idea, but my partner is married and wasn't keen on getting deported should someone decide to shine some light on our operation.

I went looking to the internet again thinking we could make videos of our classes and sell that. We made a test video and sent it to our students. The ALG system is story based, there are no books and no translation, so it's very dependent on visual feedback. I need to see my students to know if they understand me. If you are listening to a language you don't understand and you get lost, it's difficult to get back into the story. We didn't have the feedback when making videos so we had to assume understanding. None of the students liked the video. They had a hard time following since we weren't repeating ourselves like we would in person when we could see that they didn't understand. We concluded that teaching language, in person or on the internet, wasn't in the cards and gave it up.

## English Teaching Website

Still interested in silent period teaching methodologies, I thought I'd start a website about teaching English and weave in my philosophy along the way. I started a podcast interviewing English teachers around Asia and quickly decided I didn't care about the standard expat teaching experience. It has been talked about many times on many other sites. I started looking for teachers with something to say who might be willing to write about their experience and reached out. I asked if they'd like to write for me and was rejected by all.

I learned a lot from this project about advertising and software to run the ad buy, since that was how I planned to monetize. As I look back over my failed projects every one has taught me something. It was a slog, but I didn't know what else to do. The site lasted only a few months and I shut it down.

## Marketing

Two things converged and I decided to try my hand a marketing. First, when I was attending the AUA school in Bangkok I became friends with the director and he asked for my help with their online ad spend. They were using Google AdWords and while it was bringing leads, it wasn't optimized. They were bidding on things like "learn Thai for free." Anyone searching for "free" is not likely to become a student. I made some tweaks and after a few months he reported I had saved him $200 a month with no noticeable loss in registrations. Second was my failed English in Asia website. I knew the major reason I was unable to get people to write for me was I was unable to sell it. Then through some connections I was offered a "job" compensated by room and board at a homestay in northern Thailand and saw it as a chance to work on some marketing skills.

I was intended to stay three months, but I only made it two. I was told before going that the homestay was having a hard time attracting clientele. They had hired an agency, but didn't like the customers the agency sent and were looking for a better fit. Turns out they didn't know what they were looking for, so I'm not sure the agency did anything wrong. It was difficult to come up with a strategy and have them change the target customer. After the third complete change in strategy, I decided to leave.

A few months later I saw an email about a growth hacker position with a local company and applied. The company was willing to give me a shot even though I had little in the way of experience. I did email marketing and the like for about six months, the whole while not liking the work. I then realized it wasn't the homestay or my current employer, it was the work. Marketing, while important, is not fun. Luckily it was about this time that the company shifted focus and wanted to update their website, and even more lucky that all their web developers were away. I was given the job and did well enough to be given client work and have been doing web development since.
