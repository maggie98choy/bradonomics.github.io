Paul Graham has a number of essays that I find intriguing. One thing he talks about is how your location matters. Being in close proximity to other people doing what you want to do is a big deal.

But what about the internet, is that not a place where you can connect to people doing what you want to be doing?

I'm so introverted I wouldn't go out to meet people if we lived in the same city anyway. What good would it do me to pay San Francisco rent if I only talked to people online. I can do that from Chiang Mai for a fraction of the cost.





Hackers & Painters: Big Ideas From the Computer Age (Paul Graham)

GOOD DESIGN HAPPENS IN CHUNKS. The inhabitants of fifteenth century Florence included Brunelleschi, Ghiberti, Donatello, Masaccio, Filippo Lippi, Fra Angelico, Verrocchio, Botticelli, Leonardo, and Michelangelo. Milan at the time was as big as Florence. How many fifteenth century Milanese artists can you name? Something was happening in Florence in the fifteenth century. And it can't have been genetic, because it isn't happening now. You have to assume that whatever inborn ability Leonardo and Michelangelo had, there were people born in Milan with just as much. What happened to the Milanese Leonardo? There are roughly a thousand times as many people alive in the US right now as lived in Florence during the fifteenth century. A thousand Leonardos and a thousand Michel Angelos walk among us. If DNA ruled, we should be greeted daily by artistic marvels. We aren't, and the reason is that to make Leonardo you need more than his innate ability. You also need Florence in 1450. Nothing is more powerful than a community of talented people working on related problems. Genes count for little by comparison: being a genetic Leonardo was not enough to compensate for having been born near Milan instead of Florence. Today we move around more, but great work still comes disproportionately from a few hotspots: the Bauhaus, the Manhattan Project, The New Yorker, Lockheed's Skunk Works, Xerox Parc. At any given time there are a few hot topics and a few groups doing great work on them, and it's nearly impossible to do good work yourself if you're too far removed from one of these centers. You can push or pull these trends to some extent, but you can't break away from them. (Maybe you can, but the Milanese Leonardo couldn't.)
