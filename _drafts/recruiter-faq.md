## Are you available for contract work?

Certainly. Please [email me][mailto:brad@bradonomics.com].

## Are you available for full-time employment?

Maybe.

It would have to be a project I was really interested in working on. Even more so if I'm expected to come to an office everyday.

Even at that you should know that I'm a terrible employee in the eye's of most employers. If you bring me on, I *will* try to change your business. I'm not interested in a position where I'm expected to do as I'm told or follow existing outlines with no ability to add or change the standard operating procedures. By extension, as I give my opinion on things that need to change, if nothing I say is ever implemented, I will get frustrated and leave. Better that you know what type of employee you're hiring for before you start looking at candidates, it will save everyone involved from the frustration of a bad fit.

If this hasn't scared you away, tell me how your team works:

  - What are you working on and why should I be interested?
  - How do you communicate internally?
  - How do you keep track of bugs, code changes, etc.?

## Are you willing to relocate?

The implication behind this question is: are you willing to work in my office?

The answer is likely: no.

Nothing I will do for you will require me to be in any particular place and I work better when I'm not distracted. I would consider a position that required some time in your office, but I would not consider something that required 40 hours per week in your office.

## Can we have a quick phone call to chat?

I'll answer the phone for my mom, my girlfriend, and a handful of long-time friends. For everyone else, there's email: [brad@bradonomics.com][mailto:brad@bradonomics.com].
