 - The reason you can't learn a second language is because you insist on practicing. The trying is the problem.
 - Universities arrange their curriculum backwards. E.g.: Managerial Accounting should come before Accounting I and II.
 - Most people that say they love their jobs or are glad they had kids do so because of [sunk cost bias](https://litemind.com/sunk-cost-bias/) and refuse to let themselves admit that they'd rather have done things differently.
 - One should get one's ass kicked for referring to oneself as one.
 - Using they as singular is far less annoying than using he/she.

The above was inspired by the impressive list Derek Sivers gave on the Tim Ferriss podcast when asked "What do you believe that others think is insane?" I hope to improve this over time, so check back.
